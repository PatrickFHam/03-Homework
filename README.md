## How it Works
- The user will be prompted whether or not they want to customize the properties of the password.  If not, a generic one is given.
- If customized, the next few prompts will ask for the number of characters, and if they want to use lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.
- The generated password is displayed.
